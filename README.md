# HTML  
    HTML file was used to format hidden elements that become visible depending on how the page is traversed. The bulk of this website runs on using the display attribute and thus everything needed to be layed out in HTML. 
    I think I did a better job organizing the structure and making use of flexboxes in this assignment! :D

# CSS
    Simply just styling. The requirements didn't mention anything about adaptability to multiple screen pages so I didn't bother stressing over it. 

# JS
    Code used to make the page interactable. Uses buttons, forms, and dispaly attributes to manipulate what is visible to create the illusion of moving pages. 

    While the page doesn't have actual content but just place holders, this was still a pain in the ass to code. Unfortunately with all the time and effort I put into this code, it still isn't optimized and effecient. 

# Issues
    I couldn't really figure out how to work with the local storage and create attribute scripts to maintain the old scores. It keeps only the last entry and clears the rest if the viewer refreshes the page. I guess it's due to the added HTML elements being refreshed, but to store those values into local storage was odd.

# Lesson/Takeaway
    I'm sure I could have definetly optimized this code by using more arrays, booleanas and functions. I'll try to incorporate them into the next assignment.
